# Project 2 Game Aesthetics
Our Game is Parrot Paradise. This game is a 2D exploration game where you traverse the map looking for crackers. To win, you need to find all the crackers for your parrot friend.
You can move around using WASD in this pixel art world. Some joys with this game was creating the map and drawing using the tile map. It was both fun and a creative experience.
Some struggles we had was getting the dialogue to work correctly and also creating a restart function.
